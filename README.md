# jumpnbump-libretro

This is a game for the whole family. You are cute fluffy little bunnies
and hop on the other bunnies' heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to jump
over the tree trunk if you want to play and walk right.
Then you'll enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the
other bunnies' heads...

### Controls
Leap over the log, and bound off to the right to play.
The different rabbits are controlled with:

                     DOTT    LEFT/RIGHT/UP
                     JIFFY   A/D/W
                     FIZZ    Mouse Buttons
                     MIJJI   Joystick

a,w,d to steer Dott
arrows to steer Jiffy
j,i,l to steer Fizz
4,8,6 to steer Mijji (on the numeric pad)

Jump around like crazy and try to get on top of the others.

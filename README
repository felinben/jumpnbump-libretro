Jump n Bump

This is a game for the whole family. You are cute fluffy little bunnies
and hop on the other bunnies' heads.

At the beginning you are in the menu, where you have to jump
over the tree trunk if you want to play and walk right.
Then you'll enter the arena. The aim is to jump on the
other bunnies' heads...
